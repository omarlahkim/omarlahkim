### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is **Lahkim Omar**, mobile & web developer from Morocco. I used to be a Social Marketer with over 30 million views on Youtube, more than 700 thousand followers on Facebook, and some products sold on Ebay as a Dropshipper. I usually write code for fun, but when Iâ€™m asked to it for someone it would be probably for money ðŸ˜….  I have many interesting projects in my mind, so **STAY TUNED**.
